## Introduction
This room provides information on agentic AI and how they can plan and act on multi-step plans to accomplish goals.

Agentic AI uses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve its ability to perform complex tasks involving multiple steps on its own. It has the limitation that it makes up facts and propagates error throughout the reasoning process.

`ReAct (Reason + Act)` addresses this limitation by providing transparency to its otherwise hidden thought process and exeucting operations in an external environment.
